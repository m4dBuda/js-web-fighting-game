## Description
Browser Fighting Game that I created for fun because I had nothing more interesting to do. =)

## Roadmap
List of features I want to add:
- Pixel art video for game opening.
- Home Screen with Single-Player and Multi-Player options available. 
- Hero screen selector with at least 10 different heros.
- More maps where we'll have exclusive features and interactions with the enviroment.
- AI to make it possible to play a single-player campaign.
- Campaign with final boss and pixel art video ending.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute if you want to. I'd love to deploy this game in a Cloud and have it free-to-play for anyone who wants to.
Just clone the repo, open a PR and ask for a code review. =)
